- 👋 Hi, I’m @ProbingCoding
- 👀 I’m interested in finding a coding community to share projects and learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently completing the freeCodeCamp courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on freeCodeCamp learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: on GitHub? Is that a thing? I don't know, I'm new.
- 😄 Pronouns: He.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm graduated BSc Biomedical Sciences with First Class Honours. And I'm not fulfilled. Hence, I'm ProbingCoding!
